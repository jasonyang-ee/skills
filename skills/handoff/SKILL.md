  Gather the session-to-session baton for HANDOFF.md at repo root and hand it to
  encode-docs, which writes it — the baton for multi-phase PLAN.md execution. Captures current phase.task status, exact stopping point, next phase.task pointer, and watchouts. It will flip status and mark completion in PLAN.md if task is done. The cook skill invokes this at the end of every session; also triggers on "/handoff".

# handoff — session baton

The next session starts cold. HANDOFF.md is everything it must know that
PLAN.md, SPEC.md, and git history do NOT already record. Never duplicate
what those files say — point at them.

`handoff` GATHERS the baton content; it does NOT write `HANDOFF.md` directly.
`encode-docs` is the sole mutator (§V16): it owns the format and performs the
write. This skill collects the state below, then hands it to `encode-docs`,
which emits the baked header + lean `F<n>.T<n>` template and overwrites the file.

## WHEN

- End of every working session.
- Context budget running low mid-phase.
- Before any risky long-running operation.
- User asks.

## GATHER → hand to encode-docs

Collect the facts below and pass them to `encode-docs`. It writes `HANDOFF.md`
(repo root, overwritten in full — git keeps history) with its own lean template;
do NOT reproduce that template here — encode-docs owns the shape.

- branch | last commit `<sha>` `<subject>` | tests `<green | RED: named>`
- baseline `<green | RED: file+test>` | oracle `<cmd>`
- uncommitted: `<none | files + why>`
- done this session: `<F<n>.T<n>>: <one line> → <sha>`
- in progress: `<F<n>.T<n>>: mid-edit files: <paths | none>`
- next: `<F<n>.T<n>> | preconditions: <gates | none>`
- deviations & decisions; watchouts
- final verification table

## RULES

1. **Uncommitted work is a first-class fact.** Name every uncommitted file and
   why it was left so. Prefer committing (even a `~` wip §T flip) over a dirty
   tree.
2. **Red tests named exactly** — file + test name — never "some failing".
3. **Test state distinguishes baseline from current oracle** — each with its
   exact command and named failures.
5. **NEXT TASK is executable verbatim** by a cold agent: file, function, action
   — never "continue the phase". Reference done tasks and next as `F<n>.T<n>`.
7. **Only the final-verify phase fills the final verification table**; others
   leave the header row.
8. **Commit HANDOFF.md** — inside the session's final phase commit or its own,
   per repo conventions. A standalone baton commit goes through `encode-commit`:
   which phase closed, the next task, and the test state, in plain English. No
   phase ids, no encoding symbols, never a bare `docs: handoff`.

## NON-GOALS

- Not a status dashboard (PLAN §T is), not a changelog (CHANGELOG.md is),
  not a diary. State that helps the NEXT session act — nothing else.
